{"tagline":"A fully-fledged MMORPG mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim","body":"SkyNet is an experimental MMORPG modification for Bethesda's [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim/).\r\n\r\nSkyNet intends to focus heavily on roleplay and immersion, instead of just being multiplayer slapped on top of Skyrim, like previous multiplayer modifications. It uses [Alexander Blade's Script Dragon](http://alexander.sannybuilder.com/?altname=skyrim_script_dragon) to manipulate the game API with a mixed-mode (CLR/Native) plugin, which allows us to use C# as well as native C++, making our development and debug cycles considerably faster.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
